I do have a sense of whether a particular story seems plausible; and I think that in judging whether this simulation is realistic what I and most people will tend to do is make up a story about what\\'s happening; and then substitute the question \"is this story plausible\" for \"is this simulation realistic\". But these aren\\'t the same question at all. For example; different people may come up with entirely different stories; some of which they will find plausible; others implausible. I considered the drastic variation in uncertainty by Helga implausible; for example; but a convincing narrative could probably make it seem plausible to me!
