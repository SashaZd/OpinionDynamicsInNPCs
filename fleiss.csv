253,"1-14: It's very hard to form a narrative from the raw; dry statistics presented here; and consequently extremely hard to judge whether it feels ""realistic"". I don't have a good knowledge of what kinds of statistical changes in arguments are common; and I suspect most people don't either. I do have a sense of whether a particular story seems plausible; and I think that in judging whether this simulation is realistic what I and most people will tend to do is make up a story about what's happening; and then substitute the question ""is this story plausible"" for ""is this simulation realistic"". But these aren't the same question at all. For example; different people may come up with entirely different stories; some of which they will find plausible; others implausible. I considered the drastic variation in uncertainty by Helga implausible; for example; but a convincing narrative could probably make it seem plausible to me! So I worry about the potential for ""just so story"" syndrome here - for making up a story that fits what you want to believe about the nature of human conversations.",#NotEnoughInfo #NPCMentionedUnmprompted #Meta,#Infer #InferFactsFrom,,#NPCMentionedUnmprompted #Meta,
